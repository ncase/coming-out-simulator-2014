**Coming Out Simulator 2014**    
a half-true game about half-truths.

Be careful what you say. In this conversation simulator, everyone will
remember every dialogue option you pick, and your choices drive the story.
This game is semi-autobiographical. You play as a fictionalized version
of this game's author in the year 2010, during a night that changed their
life forever. If that seems confusing or awkward, well, that's the gist of
being forced to come out to one's parents, isn't it?
